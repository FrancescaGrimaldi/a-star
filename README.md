This repository contains the source code of the 2nd assignment of the **"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"** course held at NTNU during the Fall 2023 semester.

It consists in implementing the **A\* algorithm** to find the shortest path between different points, representing the position of a person in one of the rooms of the _Samfundet_ building.

The detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/intro-to-ai-assignments/blob/main/assignment%202/assignment_2.pdf).
